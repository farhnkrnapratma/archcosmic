This is a script to automate the installation process of the COSMIC desktop
environment on Arch Linux and its derivatives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. üöÄ The fastest way: curl

Run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farhnkrnapratma/archcosmic/main/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. üìã Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/farhnkrnapratma/archcosmic.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repo

```bash
cd archcosmic
```

3. Verify the installation script authenticity (You probably should do this)

- Verify using `sha512sum`

```bash
sha512sum -c install.sh.sha512
```

If valid, you should see this:

```bash
install.sh: OK
```

- Verify using `gpg`

Before verifying any signed files, make sure to download the PGP public key first:

```bash
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 8A56804F34FF6D2F5F1310257B2BCDEB698FA58C
```

Once the key is imported, you can verify the signature with:

```bash
gpg --verify install.sh.sig install.sh
```

If it is valid and the public key matches, you should see this:

```bash
gpg: Signature made Wed 06 Aug 2025 03:08:28 PM WIB
gpg:                using EDDSA key 0E8993B46423C2217F7E899BE9DE181A84887F4F
gpg: Good signature from "Farhan Kurnia Pratama (Farhan Kurnia Pratama PGP Key) <farhnkrnapratma@protonmail.com>" [ultimate]
```

5. Add execution permission for the script

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

5. Then, run the script and relax until the process is complete ‚òï

```bash
./install.sh
```
