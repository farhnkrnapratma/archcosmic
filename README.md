This is a script to automate the installation process of the COSMIC desktop
environment on Arch Linux and its derivatives.

## üìç Requirements

- ‚úÖ `git` installed
- ‚úÖ `base-devel` installed
- ‚úÖ `yay` installed
- ‚è∫Ô∏è (Optional) `chaotic-aur` repo enabled

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

> üìñ Note: All COSMIC desktop environment packages are installed from the Chaotic-AUR
repository. If you want to use the official version from the Arch Linux
repository, please add the `--arch` argument before running the installation
script.

### 1. üöÄ The fastest way: curl

Run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions.

```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farhnkrnapratma/archcosmic/main/install-<version>.sh | sh
```

Or if you want to use the official version from the Arch Linux repo:

```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farhnkrnapratma/archcosmic/main/install-<version>.sh | sh -s -- --arch
```

### 2. üìã Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/farhnkrnapratma/archcosmic.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repo

```bash
$ cd archcosmic
```

3. Verify the installation script authenticity (You probably should do this)

- Verify using `sha512sum`

```bash
$ sha512sum -c install-<version>.sh.sha512
```

If valid, you should see this:

```bash
install-v1.1.sh: OK
```

- Verify using `gpg`

```bash
$ gpg --verify install-<version>.sh.sig install-<version>.sh
```

If it is valid and the public key matches, you should see this:

```bash
gpg: Signature made Thu 31 Jul 2025 06:08:56 PM WIB
gpg:                using EDDSA key 0E8993B46423C2217F7E899BE9DE181A84887F4F
gpg: Good signature from "Farhan Kurnia Pratama (Farhan Kurnia Pratama PGP Key) <farhnkrnapratma@protonmail.com>" [ultimate]
```

5. Add execution permission for the script

```bash
$ chmod +x install-<version>.sh
```

5. Then, run the script and relax until the process is complete ‚òï

```bash
$ ./install-<version>.sh
# or ./install-<version>.sh --arch
```
